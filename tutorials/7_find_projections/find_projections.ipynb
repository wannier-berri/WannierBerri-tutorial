    "This tutorial explains how to find suitable projections for a given DFT bandstructure and specified frozen window.\n",

    "Automating Wannier Functions Inspired by Topological Quantum Chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "Wannier functions (WFs) have become a popular and powerful technique for studying the diverse electronic properties of materials. However, the construction of high-quality WFs remains a non-trivial task, often requiring manual intervention and expertise, which obstructs high-throughput calculations using WF-based methods. A crucial aspect of WF construction is the selection of initial projections, which serve as an initial guess for the WFs. Traditionally, these projections are chosen based on knowledge of the orbital character of the bands under study (within a frozen window), which requires visual inspection of the bands, and hence quite some expertise and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, I present an alternative approach for selecting initial projections based on the symmetry indicators (irreducible representations) of DFT Bloch bands. The method is inspired by Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC) [Nature 547, 298 (2017)]. Briefly, from TCS, we know the following : \n",
    "\n",
    "* If we take an isolated set of bands, and compute the irreducible representations (irreps) of the bands at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, we can determine the topological properties of the bands.\n",
    "* If the same set of irreps can be generated by placing Wannier functions at certain Wyckoff positions in the unit cell, then the bands are either topologically trivial (if all WFs are on atomic sites) or an obstructed atomic limit (if some WFs are on empty Wyckoff positions).\n",
    "* If the irreps cannot be generated by placing WFs at Wyckoff positions, then the bands are topologically non-trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we are interested to describe precisely the bands in a certain energy range (frozen window), and we may include some more states to the outer window to ensure that the WFs are well-localized. The method presented here is based on the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the irreps of the bands in the frozen window at **all** irreducible k-points in the Brillouin zone.\n",
    "2. Define a set of trial wyckoff positions (WP) and trial orbitals for the WFs. (as a maximum one can include all Wyckoff positions and all orbitals (s,p,d,f) for each WP, but to speed up the calculations, one can include only the most relevant ones). each pair (WP, orbital) defines a set of trial projections, or an elementary band representation (EBR).\n",
    "3. Compute the irreps of the trial WFs at all irreducible k-points in the Brillouin zone. (the symmetry indicators of each EBR)\n",
    "4. Find such integer (non-negative) coefficients for the EBRs that for each k-point the sum of the EBRs yields at least all the irreps of the bands in the frozen window, and at the same time the sum of the EBRs fits into irreps of the bands in the outer window.\n",
    "5. If some of EBRs are generated by WPs with free parameters (like (x,x,1/2) or (x,y,z)), then the free parameters can be optimized to maximize the minimal distance between different WPs.\n",
    "6. The resulting trial positions are printed in the order of increasing number of Wannier functions. The input for wannier90.win file is also printed for the user's convenience.\n",
    " \n",
    " Furhter user can try different sets of trial projections, generate the wannier90.amn file and construct the wannier functions, either using Wannier90, or WannierBerri. It is preferred to use Symmetry adapted wannier functions (SAWFs) [Sakuma, PRB 87, 235109 (2013)] in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    " In complicated cases some of the projections sets may result WFs that are not well localized, and do not provide good wannierisation. But there will be a number of sets, so by try-and-error one can find the best set of projections. Further, this try-and-error can be automated (work in progress).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "This method does not require manual inspection of the orbital character of the bands, which makes it suitable for high-throughput calculations.\n",
